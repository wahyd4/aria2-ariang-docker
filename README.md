## Usage it in Docker compose

  Please refer <https://github.com/wahyd4/aria2-ariang-x-docker-compose>

## FAQ
  1. When you running the docker image with non `80` port or you have HTTPS enabled, you will meet the error says `Aria2 Status Disconnected`, then you will need to go to `AriaNg Settings` -> RPC (at the top of the page) to modify the port value in `Aria2 RPC Address` field. Due to AriaNg store all configurations in local browser, so you need to do this per browser.
  2. If there is no speed at all when you downloading a BitTorrent file, please try to use a popular torrent file first to help the application to cache `DHT` file. Then the speed should get fast and fast, as well as downloading other links.
